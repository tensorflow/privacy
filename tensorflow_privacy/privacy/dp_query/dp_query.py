"""An interface for differentially private query mechanisms.

The DPQuery class abstracts the differential privacy mechanism needed by DP-SGD.

The nomenclature is not specific to machine learning, but rather comes from
the differential privacy literature. Therefore, instead of talking about
examples, minibatches, and gradients, the code talks about records, samples and
queries. For more detail, please see the paper here:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06210.pdf

A common usage paradigm for this class is centralized DP-SGD training on a
fixed set of training examples, which we call "standard DP-SGD training."
In such training, SGD applies as usual by computing gradient updates from a set
of training examples that form a minibatch. However, each minibatch is broken
up into disjoint "microbatches."  The gradient of each microbatch is computed
and clipped to a maximum norm, with the "records" for all such clipped gradients
forming a "sample" that constitutes the entire minibatch. Subsequently, that
sample can be "queried" to get an averaged, noised gradient update that can be
applied to model parameters.

In order to prevent inaccurate accounting of privacy parameters, the only
means of inspecting the gradients and updates of SGD training is via the use
of the below interfaces, and through the accumulation and querying of a
"sample state" abstraction. Thus, accessing data is indirect on purpose.

The DPQuery class also allows the use of a global state that may change between
samples. In the common situation where the privacy mechanism remains unchanged
throughout the entire training process, the global state is usually None.

class DPQuery(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
  """Interface for differentially private query mechanisms.

  Differential privacy is achieved by processing records to bound sensitivity,
  accumulating the processed records (usually by summing them) and then
  adding noise to the aggregated result. The process can be repeated to compose
  applications of the same mechanism, possibly with different parameters.

  The DPQuery interface specifies a functional approach to this process. A
  global state maintains state that persists across applications of the
  mechanism. For each application, the following steps are performed:

  1. Use the global state to derive parameters to use for the next sample of
     records.
  2. Initialize a sample state that will accumulate processed records.
  3. For each record:
     a. Process the record.
     b. Accumulate the record into the sample state.
  4. Get the result of the mechanism, possibly updating the global state to use
     in the next application.
  5. Derive metrics from the global state.

  Here is an example using the GaussianSumQuery. Assume there is some function
  records_for_round(round) that returns an iterable of records to use on some
  round.

  ```
  dp_query = tensorflow_privacy.GaussianSumQuery(
      l2_norm_clip=1.0, stddev=1.0)
  global_state = dp_query.initial_global_state()

  for round in range(num_rounds):
    sample_params = dp_query.derive_sample_params(global_state)
    sample_state = dp_query.initial_sample_state()
    for record in records_for_round(round):
      sample_state = dp_query.accumulate_record(
          sample_params, sample_state, record)

    result, global_state = dp_query.get_noised_result(
        sample_state, global_state)
    metrics = dp_query.derive_metrics(global_state)

    # Do something with result and metrics...
