"""Computes per-example loss clip weights.

For a given Keras model and batch of inputs, computes the per-example
clip weights so that the gradient of the loss function, weighted by these
weights, is equivalent to the gradient of the original loss function but
with the per-example gradients clipped by some clip weight. Uses a variant
of the approach given in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03106.pdf (see the
`compute_gradient_norms()` function).

  Args:

      loss of the model *must* be a scalar loss.
    layer_registry: A `LayerRegistry` instance containing functions that help
      compute gradient norms quickly. See
      `tensorflow_privacy.privacy.fast_gradient_clipping.layer_registry` for
      more details.
    x_batch: An `InputTensor` representing a batch of inputs to the model. The
      first axis must be the batch dimension.
    y_batch: A `tf.Tensor` representing a batch of output labels. The first axis
      must be the batch dimension. The number of examples should match the
      number of examples in `x_batch`.
    weight_batch: Optional batch of weights, passed to the loss function.
    per_example_loss_fn: takes as input predictions, labels and weights, and
      outputs a vector of per-example losses. If None, derived from
      `input_model.loss` by disabling its reduction.
    num_microbatches: An optional number or scalar `tf.Tensor` for the number of
      microbatches. If not None, indicates that the loss is grouped into
      num_microbatches (in this case, the batch dimension needs to be a multiple
      of num_microbatches). When there is microbatches, we always assume the
      loss is the mean over a microbatch. And the gradient norm is computed for
      each microbatch.
    trainable_vars: The list of variables included in computing the gradient
      norm. When a layer has multiple variables, we include all the variables if
      any of the variables is in the list. If `trainable_vars` is None, all the
      variables are included.

    example loss (when num_microbatches is None) or the norm of the gradient of

  loss function whose gradient for each example has l2-norm at most

      will have norm at most `l2_norm_clip`.
    layer_registry: A `dict` of layers that support "fast" gradient norm
      computations. The key is the class of the layer and the value is a
      function that returns a `tuple` `(output, sqr_grad_norms, vars)`, where

    weight_batch: Optional vector of weights, passed to the loss function. Must

      microbatches. If not None, indicates that the loss is grouped into
      num_microbatches (in this case, the batch dimension needs to be a multiple
      of num_microbatches).
    clipping_loss: If provided, used for the clipping computation. Defaults to
      `input_model.compiled_loss`. Specifying a `clipping_loss` can be useful to
      avoid calling `input_model.compiled_loss`, as this will append the value
      of the clipped loss to the reported metrics, and this can be misleading as
      the value of the clipped loss does not reflect the true loss.
