# Faster Differentially Private Convex Optimization via Second-Order Methods

### Arun Ganesh, Mahdi Haghifam, Thomas Steinke, Abhradeep Guha Thakurta

This repository contains the code for our paper on Faster Differentially Private Convex Optimization via Second-Order Methods. 

You can use this repository to run different DP convex optimization algorithms and compare their convergence and privacy-utility tradeoff.

## How to run

For the results on the convergence run `./script_convergence`.

For the results on the privacy-utility tradeoff run `./script_privacy_utility`.
