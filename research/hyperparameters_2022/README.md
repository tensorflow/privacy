# Hyperparameter Tuning with Renyi Differential Privacy
### Nicolas Papernot and Thomas Steinke

This repository contains the code used to reproduce some of the experiments in our [ICLR 2022 paper on hyperparameter tuning with differential privacy](https://openreview.net/forum?id=-70L8lpp9DF).

You can reproduce Figure 7 in the paper by running `figure7.py`. It loads by default values used to plot the figure contained in the paper, and we also included a dictionary `lr_acc.json` containing the accuracy of a large number of ML models trained with different learning rates. If you'd like to try our approach to fine-tune your own parameters, you will have to modify the code that interacts with this dictionary (`lr_acc` in the code from `figure7.py`).
