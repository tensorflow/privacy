# Requirements for Tensorflow Privacy.

# If you add a dependency here, also add the dependency to setup.py.
#
# *   For packages that have a stable release, we use a version that is
#     compatible with that release (e.g. `~=x.y`). See
#     https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#compatible-release for more information.
# *   For packages that do not have a stable release, we use a version that
#     matches a release that has been tested (e.g. `==x.y.z`). See
#     https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-matching for more information.
#
# This assumes that the packages follows Semantic Versioning, see
# https://semver.org/. If a package follows a different versioning scheme or
# requires unique handling, we use a different version specifier and comment the
# versioning scheme or reasoning.
#
# Note: As of 2022-08-17 there is bug in `pip` when multiple packages use the
# compatible release operator `~=` to specify a version and one of those
# versions ends in `0`. See https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9613 for more
# information. In this case, use the equivalent clause `>=x.0,==x.*` instead of
# `~=x.0`.
