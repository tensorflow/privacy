"""An interface for differentially private query mechanisms.

The DPQuery class abstracts the differential privacy mechanism needed by DP-SGD.

The nomenclature is not specific to machine learning, but rather comes from
the differential privacy literature. Therefore, instead of talking about
examples, minibatches, and gradients, the code talks about records, samples and
queries. For more detail, please see the paper here:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06210.pdf

A common usage paradigm for this class is centralized DP-SGD training on a
fixed set of training examples, which we call "standard DP-SGD training."
In such training, SGD applies as usual by computing gradient updates from a set
of training examples that form a minibatch. However, each minibatch is broken
up into disjoint "microbatches."  The gradient of each microbatch is computed
and clipped to a maximum norm, with the "records" for all such clipped gradients
forming a "sample" that constitutes the entire minibatch. Subsequently, that
sample can be "queried" to get an averaged, noised gradient update that can be
applied to model parameters.

In order to prevent inaccurate accounting of privacy parameters, the only
means of inspecting the gradients and updates of SGD training is via the use
of the below interfaces, and through the accumulation and querying of a
"sample state" abstraction. Thus, accessing data is indirect on purpose.

The DPQuery class also allows the use of a global state that may change between
samples. In the common situation where the privacy mechanism remains unchanged
throughout the entire training process, the global state is usually None.
